# Statistics Project - Crude Oil Exports and Production in Ghana from 2002 to 2019  

## Introduction
Using basic statistics concepts, such a bar graph and time series, this project explores two datasets containing information about crude oil exports and production by the Energy Commission of Ghana from 2002 to 2019.

### Dataset Description
The datasets were downloaded from the Ghana Open Data Initiative website via this link: (https://data.gov.gh/dataset/crude-oil-2000-2019). The datasets were made available by the Energy Commission of Ghana and can be accessed by the general public. The datasets have two columns: Year and Crude Oil Exports/Crude Oil Production with 20 entries.

### Data Issues
1. Columns are not labelled properly; 2; Some rows contain text which are not needed; 3. Year is in object format; 4. Crude oil export and production values are in object format

### Conclusion
I analysed the Crude Oil Export and Production datasets in this project. From the bar graphs, both crude oil exports and production, in millions of barrels continued to increase throughout the years (from 2002 to 2019). However, the time series analysis showed that from 2002 to 2009, Ghana was producing and exporting the same amount of crude oil. After 2009, Ghana began exporting less of its crude oil, up until 2019.

Further data analysis can be done to explore why Ghana started exporting less of its crude oil after 2009.
